# Type Inference Experiment

I wanted to play around with a language with static types and type inference
and answer some questions:

- How do we keep track of the type?
- How do we infer a type if none is given?
- How do we infer a type of a built-in method if it exists on more than one class/type?

**This is my playground.**
